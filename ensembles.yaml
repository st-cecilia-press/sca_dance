  description: Musica Subterranea is a group of artists skilled in both dance and music who became friends in the Society for Creative Anachronism (sca.org). We love historic reenactment, and we noticed the great deal of time, effort, and money involved in finding good dance music in the SCA without pirating someone else's collection. Back in 1997, we decided to address the problem by producing music for SCA dance that was easy to get, inexpensive to purchase, and copyright clean. Our first album was released in 1999, the second in 2000, the third in 2003. Due to members moving around the country, our production slowed, but we expect to release a fourth full album in 2015. A short compilation album including three old and three new tracks was released on January 2, 2015 as part of a project in partnership with the SCA region of Pentamere in the Middle Kingdom.
