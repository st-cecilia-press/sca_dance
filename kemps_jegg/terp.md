||**Short Version:** Ignore direction to “repeat entire part 2x w/ same active Ld”||
||– Ld 1 is now active for only 1 repeat of each verse. Lds 2&3 do likewise. ||
||**Egalitarian Version:** Ignore direction to “repeat entire part 2x w/ same active|| 
||Ld” Once the Lds all been active, the dance begins again w/ the Lys active.||
